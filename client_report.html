    <h5>Client:
        <br>
        I decided what I wanted to display on my website based on things I was currently interested in. Since it was summer,
        I was interested in the best ways to spend the time with friends. I generated the logo to match the color scheme with AI, and
        found the rest on Google Images. In addition, I researched and wrote the ideas I had for summer plans. I communicated with
        my developer over email, which seemed to work pretty well, if a little sparsely. I did end up having to initiate contact
        for my URL, and, as of yet, haven't been sent it, so I'm not sure yet how the website looks. I believe next time maybe
        having a regular time to check-in would make things easier.
        <br>
        Lead Developer
        <br>
        I don't think I was the best at managing my development team. While I did get into contact with my junior developers, add them
        to the Github, and give them access to the site plan, I struggled to successfully reach out to them. I did communicate with
        my client a bit better, I think - I reached out for their site plan and gave out the URL early. Publishing the client site
        wasn't too difficult, and after a couple of mishaps, Github became pretty easy to use.
        <br>
        Junior Developer
        <br>
        My team leads each sent out the site template and added me to the Github. However, I felt like I didn't exactly know what was
        expected, and soon my homepage ended up taking top priority, leading to me finishing my junior developer pages a lot later
        than I meant to. When I began struggling to get my homepage CSS looking right, my junior developer pages fell to the wayside a
        bit, and I'm not sure there was enough communication on either side. However, Github didn't give me any trouble uploading
        my pages.
        <br>
        Reflections
        <br>
        I think the hardest part of this project for me was managing the communication, and getting my website to display successfully.
        I had a lot of trouble with the layout my client requested, since grid was not my strong suit and there were several boxed
        sections. I was determined to do it on my own, and the troubleshooting of making everything show up correctly sucked up a lot
        of time. In addition, knowing what everyone expected, how to reach out, and getting everyone on the same page was difficult.
        I think I was able to overcome it and deliver an accurate product, as well as reach out as best I could. I enjoyed having the 
        chance to create something a bit out of my comfort zone, and work with Github. I think if I could do this project again, I would
        regularly check in with both the client and my junior developers. I think I've gained a bit more confidence in working on real-world 
        projects, just in seeing how things can happen and adapting to them.
